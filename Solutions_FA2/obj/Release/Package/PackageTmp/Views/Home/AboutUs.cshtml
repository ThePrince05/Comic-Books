        <u> <h2>About Us</h2></u>
        <p>
            Robert Comics was started in 1939 by Robert Goodman as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally <br />
            become known as Atlas Comics. The Robert comic era began in 1961, the year that the company <br />
            launched The Wonderful Eight and other superhero titles created by Wilson Fisk, Thabo Sithole, <br />
            Steve Jr Biko and many others. The Robert Comics brand, which had been used over the years, <br />
            was solidified as the company's primary brand. <br />
            <br />
            Robert Comics counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Arachnid-Kid, Metal Man, African Soldier, <br />
            and Claw Man, as well as popular superhero teams such as the World Defenders and the Protecters of the Universe. <br />
            Its stable of well-known supervillains includes the likes of Healer Doom, Lavaman, Robot Evil, and<br />
            Kingpin. Most of Robert Comis' fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the RC Universe, <br />
            with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in Pretoria.<br />
            Additionally, Robert Comics has published several licensed properties from other companies. <br />
            This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and again since 2015.
